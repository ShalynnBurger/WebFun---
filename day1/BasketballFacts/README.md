This is day one of web fundamentals lecture.  Here are my notes, instructor notes, and practice coding.  This code is copied from following along with the lecture. 

How the web works:
1. we make a HTTP request to a website. example --> amazon.com
2. we get back a response from the web server that amazon.com is associated with
3. the response is a web page (front-end)
4. a web page consists of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS)
5. HTML= content of the page (bold text, regular text, buttons, form inputs, images, hyperlinks)
6. CSS = styling of the content (layout, colors, making some content next to other content)
7. JS = interacivity (clicking, hovering, scrolling, typing) between the user and web page which results in modification of the HTML and CSS 

HTML - when you move into an empty apartment and you pile all of your stuff inside (apartment with just content in it)

CSS - setting up and styling your apartment 

JS - calling a friend to bring over more things
